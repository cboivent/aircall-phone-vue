## Getting started

### Installation
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Built with 

The project was generated by Vue CLI 4. It uses: 
- Vue.js
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- Jest
- SASS
- GraphQL Apollo

The application is written in Typescript.

### Settings

Settings are define in the file `./src/constants/settings.ts`:
- `AUTH-TOKEN-NAME` define the token name store in localstorage
- `HTTP_TIMER_REFRESH_TOKEN` define the timer to refresh JWT token in milliseconds
- `HTTP_API_ENDPOINT_URI` define the GraphQL API endpoint
- `WS_API_ENDPOINT_URI` define the GraphQL API endpoint for WebSocket subscriptions
- `WS_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` define keep alive timer
- `ITEMS_PER_PAGE` define number rows displayed by page on `ACList` component

## Technical details

Vuex Store is used to store JWT token and user informations (`id` and `username`).

Subscription to GraphQL `OnUpdateCall` to handle real time events is made on the Home page.

After log in, a timer is started to refresh every 30 seconds (`HTTP_TIMER_REFRESH_TOKEN`) the JWT token.

On the home page:
- we start by requesting the API `getPaginatedCalls` to get only the total number of calls (`totalCount` - `GET_CALLS_TOTAL_COUNT`)
- We retrieve all calls with minimum informations (`id`, `created_at`) using request `GET_CALLS_ID_CREATED_AT`
- We sort and group calls list by date (`created_at`)
- We finally can display the home page content

By clicking on a group calls section, we retrieve some calls informations (`id`, `creation`, `direction`, `from`, `to`, `is_archived`) of the selected date with 1 request using alias in the GraphQL request `GET_CALLS_BY_ID`.

On an update call event:
- We start looking with the date (`create_at`) to get the group calls
- Then we search on this group the call using the `id`

```

The application contains 3 pages:
- Login Page - `/login`
- Home Page - `/` - require JWT Token
- Call details Page - `/call/:id` - require JWT Token

This pages are defined in directory `./views`:
- `Login.vue`
- `Home.vue`
- `Call.vue`

GraphQL queries (`query`, `mutation`, `subscription`) are located on directory `./graphlq` with one file by type:
- `mutations.ts`
- `queries.ts`
- `subscriptions.ts`

We define 2 services:
- `AircallService.ts` contains functions to request the Aircall API (GraphQL)
- `ApolloService.ts` initialize the GRaphQL Apollo Client (HTTP and WS)

Directory `./models` contains GraphQL types (interface) and custom interfaces / models.

Directory `./styles` contains 2 files which are automatically imported in the application in global (see `vue.config.js`):
- `_global.scss` contains common styles definitons 
- `_variables.scss` contains variables definitions

## Improvements

- Don't store the token in localstorage: security breach (XSS)
- Create component for button
- Create component for list pagination
- Add select element on pagination to change nb items displayed by page
- GraphQL client cache policies
- Add form validation on login inputs (`username` / `password`)
- Add more tests:
  - on Vue router navigation
  - on Vuex store mutations and getters
